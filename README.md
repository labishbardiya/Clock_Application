### Clock_Application: Digital Clock

The "Digital Clock" project is a comprehensive clock application developed using Python. This application encompasses four primary functionalities: Digital Clock, Alarm Clock, Stopwatch, and Timer. By leveraging the Tkinter library, Python's standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit, this project delivers a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.

## Components

#Digital Clock
The core feature of the application displays the current time in a digital format. The time is updated in real time, providing an accurate and reliable clock display.

#Alarm Clock
The alarm clock functionality allows users to set specific times for alarms. Users can input their desired alarm time, and the application will alert them accordingly at the specified time. This feature is ideal for reminders and time management.

#Stopwatch
The stopwatch feature enables users to measure elapsed time accurately. It includes start, stop, and reset functions, making it suitable for timing events or activities.

#Timer
The timer functionality allows users to set countdown timers for specific durations. Once the timer reaches zero, an alert notifies the user. This feature is useful for tasks requiring precise time tracking, such as cooking or exercising.
